      Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension
       Resize the browser window (both width and height) to see how the font-size
      of h1 changes.
    </p>
    <p>1vmax = 1vw or 1vh, whichever is larger.</p>
    <p>
      The vmax unit is not supported in Edge 15 and earlier, nor in Safari 6.1
      and earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw =
      0.5cm.
